Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Evan and I'm currently pursuing an Associate's in Computer Programming in Development at Wake Tech!

I'm passionate about technology AND people, and always eager to learn about new frameworks and how they can be leveraged to meet business requirements. 

I code most frequently in Python (including Django and Flask) and Java, but have taken introductory courses in HTML, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL. I have had exposure 
to all standard OS', coding in both Windows and Mac environments. I have also worked with Linux in a VM setting, and enjoyed the OpenSource community's welcoming 
attitude and robust documentation. 

I have experience deploying basic cloud applications using OpenShift, as well as basic working expereience in AWS and GCP. The possibilities of cloud native 
applications excites me, and I look forward to expanding my knowledge of them. 

Feel free to take a look around at my code and email me @ escarborough@my.waketech.edu if you have any questions / collaboration opportunities. 

Keep exploring ðŸš€
